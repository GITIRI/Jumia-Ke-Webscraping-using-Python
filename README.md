# Webscraping using Beautiful Soup 

This is a simple webscraper that makes use of the pandas module in python, requests and Beautiful soup. 

In the code, I make use of lists, loops and pandas dataframe to save the data I have scraped in a readable .csv table.

The code currently picks data from one page in the Jumia website.

The code is set to run after every 24 hours and the data generated includes the date of extraction.

I will update the code to automatically send an email when new data is generated using smtplib
